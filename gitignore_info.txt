gitignore files specify files that git shouldn't track.

It doesn't un-track files that are already tracked by git,
if the gitignore is added after files are already tracked,
they can be removed with "git rm --cached FILENAME"

The gitignore specifies a pattern, Git checks more than one
place for patterns to ignore with precedence (high-low):
- From the command line with some commands;
- .gitignore files in the same directory as the path
  or a parent directory with lower level files overriding
  higher level ones, patterns in this file are parsed
  relative to the file's location. This is the norm for
  a git project;
- Patterns from $GIT_DIR/info/exclude;
- Patterns from config variable core.excludesFile.

Where to put a pattern depends on its use:
- For version control and distribution to other repos
  go into a .gitignore;
- Patterns specific to a repo but also to a user should 
  go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file;
- Patterns to be ignored by Git in all situations should
  go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the
  user's ~/.gitconfig.

Some lower level git commands read patterns from command
line options or file specified there. Higher level commands
use the sources above.

Mostly paraphrased from https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
more actual rules for writing patterns and examples can
be found there too.
